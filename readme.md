<br>The main goal of this project is to create an intuitive UI to manage the most common CLI package managers for Windows, such as [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/) and [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/).  

With this app, you'll be able to download, install, update and uninstall any software that's published on the supported package managers — and so much more.

<br>**Disclaimer:** This project has no connection with the official [Winget project](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) — it's completely unofficial. 

Beware that neither Microsoft nor the creators of WingetUI are responsible for the downloaded apps.

# Features

 - The ability to install packages from Scoop and Winget (the idea is to add more package managers in the future).
 - The ability to upgrade and uninstall previously installed packages — as well as uninstall local PC apps!
 - The ability to both import and export the packages of your choice, so that you can easily install them in the future.
 - The user doesn't need to install any of the package managers. (Although the app does include the ability to install Scoop for you!)
 - Includes support for managing Scoop buckets.
 - The user can select the version that they want to install of any particular app.
 - The user will be notified whether the installation/update/uninstallation of an app was completed successfully or not.
 - The ability to queue installations in order to prevent conflicts.
 - A dark theme is available to prevent you from burning your eyes. :sunglasses:
 - The ability to show package-related information (like its license, SHA256 hash, homepage, etc.) before installation.
 - More than 6800 packages available and counting!
 - More features are coming in the future!

# Installation

<p>There are multiple ways to install WingetUI — choose whichever one you prefer!<br><br></p>

- The first is by downloading the latest version of the installer:

<p align="center"><b><a href="https://github.com/martinet101/WingetUI/releases/latest/download/WingetUI.Installer.exe">Click here to download WingetUI</a></b></p>
<br>

- The second is by using [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/):

Run the following command in PowerShell or Command Prompt: `winget install wingetui`

<br>

- The third is by using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) — see the instructions below.

<br>In case it's not already added, it's required to add the _Extras_ bucket first: `scoop bucket add extras`

Then, to install WingetUI, execute the following command: `scoop install wingetui`

# FAQ

**Q: I am unable to install or upgrade a specific Winget package! What should I do?**<br>

A: This is likely an issue with Winget rather than WingetUI. 

Please check if it's possible to install/upgrade the package through PowerShell or the Command Prompt by using the commands `winget upgrade` or `winget install`, depending on the situation (for example: `winget upgrade --id Microsoft.PowerToys`). 

If this doesn't work, consider asking for help at [Winget's own project page](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).<br>

#

**Q: The name of a package is trimmed with ellipsis — how do I see its full name/id?**<br>

A: This is a known limitation of Winget. 

See more details in issue https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/2603.<br>

#

**Q: My antivirus is telling me that WingetUI is a virus! / My browser is blocking the download of WingetUI!**<br>

A: A common reason apps (i.e., executables) get blocked and/or detected as a virus — even when there's nothing malicious about them, like in the case of WingetUI — is because they're not being used by a relatively large amount of people.

Combine that with the fact that you might be downloading something that was recently released, and simply blocking unknown apps is in many cases a good precaution to take in order to prevent actual malware.

Since WingetUI is open source and safe to use, simply whitelist the app in the settings of your antivirus/browser.<br>

#

**Q: Will Chocolatey be supported?**<br>

A: Maybe in the future. 

See more details in issue https://github.com/martinet101/WingetUI/issues/56.<br>

#

**Q: Can I add "msstore" as a source for Winget in the app?**<br>

A: This is not possible, nor is it planned for the near future. 

See more details in issue https://github.com/martinet101/WingetUI/issues/87.<br>
